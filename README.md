## 👨‍💻 About Me
I was born and live in Kahramanmaraş, Turkey. My interests include software, philosophy, and music. I love writing and coding. I'm always curious, constantly researching and learning. I spend my days coding, listening to music, reading books, or just watching series. I do all these because I love them, and one day, I dream of retreating to a green forest using Debian with the MATE desktop environment. I might even write my own operating system for my cat.

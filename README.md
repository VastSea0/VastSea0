## 👨‍💻 About Me
I was born and live in Kahramanmaraş. My interests include software, philosophy, mythology, history and music. I love writing and coding. I am always curious, researching and learning. I spend my days writing code, listening to music, reading books or watching TV series. I love doing all these things and one day I dream of retiring to a green forest using Debian with MATE desktop environment. Maybe then I can even write my own operating system for my cat.

In terms of software, I'm particularly interested in web development and I'm working on developing full-stack websites and software in the future. JavaScript is by far my favorite language. I also have a great interest in Linux systems and in the future I would like to write desktop software like Hüma. My goals include learning powerful programming languages like C/C++ and Rust.
